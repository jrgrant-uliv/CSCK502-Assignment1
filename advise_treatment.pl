%%% Symptoms of the virus varied in severity from being asymptomatic to having more than one symptoms. 
%%% Most common symptoms were fever, persistent dry cough, and tiredness. 
%%% Less common symptoms were aches and pains, sore throat, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis, headache, anosmia/hyposmia 
%%% (total/partial loss of sense of smell and taste), and running nose. 
%%% Serious symptoms included difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain or feeling of chest pressure, loss of speech or movement. 
%%% People with serious symptoms needed to seek immediate medical attention, proceeding with an initial assessment call (no contacts) 
%%% to the doctor or health facility. People with mild symptoms had to manage their symptoms at home, without a doctor assessment. 
%%% Elderly people (above 70 year old) and those with pre-existent health conditions 
%%% (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer) were considered to be more at risk of developing severe symptoms. 
%%% Males in these groups also appeared to be at a slightly higher risk than females. 
%%% Most infected people developed mild to moderate illness and recovered without hospitalization.
